# ISTA-Net
Implementing ISTA-Net, an interpretable optimization-inspired deep network for image compressive sensing as proposed by Zhang and Ghanem in [this paper.](Zhang_ISTA-Net_Interpretable_Optimization-Inspired_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf)

## How to run
Download the dataset `Training_Data_Img91.mat` from [this link,](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RBYOg6F2dxGWoCrBvQyf93hXI-OEfzHs) place it in the current directory and then run `ista_net.py`
Interactive training and experimentation was done in Google Colab, and the Jupyter notebook has been uploaded in the current directory as `ista_net_jupyter.ipynb`

## Observations and assumptions
